## Azure Retail Prices API Review
Based on the REST API, `https://prices.azure.com/api/retail/prices` provided, the general [API response structure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices#api-response-examples) are shown below:

### First _layer_ JSON object
The first layer consists of six objects as shown below.
```json
{
  "BillingCurrency": "USD",
  "CustomerEntityId": "Default",
  "CustomerEntityType": "Retail",
  "Items": [...]
  "NextPageLink": "https://prices.azure.com:443/api/retail/prices?$skip=100",
  "Count": 100
}
```

The table below are created for my own learning purposes and the full description can be found in [Azure REST API property details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices#api-property-details). The descriptions of each fields above are described below:

| Fields | Example Values | Definition |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BillingCurrency` | `USD` | The currency that Microsoft currently uses to price all Azure services and USD currency are Microsoft retail prices. |
| `CustomerEntityId` | `Default` | No references can be found, it was assumed that `Default` was used generic way to show public retail prices. |
| `CustomerEntityType` | `Retail` | No references can be found, assume that `Retail` is used as a generic way to show the most likely customers using this API. |
| `Items` | `[array of objects]` | `Items` consists an array of objects which contains detailed information about Azure services and products. |
| `NextPageLink` | `https://prices.azure.com:443/api/retail/prices?$skip=100` | The API response provides [pagination](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices#api-response-pagination). At the end of the API response, it has the link to next page |
| `Count` | `100` |  For each API request, a maximum of [100 records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices#api-response-pagination) are returned. |

### Second _layer_ JSON object
The JSON responded with an array of object nested within `Items`. Below shows an example of a typical JSON object properties:
```json

      "type": "DevTestConsumption",
      "isPrimaryMeterRegion": true,
      "armSkuName": "Standard_D14"
 }
```
The table below are created for my own learning purposes and the full description can be found in [Azure REST API property details](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices#api-property-details).

### Nomenclature Breakdown
The Azure virtual machine (VM) nomenclature will be used to _translate_ VM names into descriptions such as storage, vCPU, and memory.

#### Example
**[Family]** + _[Sub-family]*_ + **[# of vCPUs]** + _[Constrained vCPUs]*_ + **[Additive Features]** + _[Accelerator Type]*_ + **[Version]**

| Value | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Family | Indicates the VM Family Series |
| \*Sub-family | Used for specialized VM differentiations only |
| # of vCPUs | Denotes the number of vCPUs of the VM |
| \*Constrained vCPUs | Used for certain VM sizes only. Denotes the number of vCPUs for the [constrained vCPU capable size](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/constrained-vcpu) |
| Additive Features | One or more lower case letters denote additive features, such as:
|  | a = AMD-based processor |
|  | d = diskfull (local temp disk is present); this is for newer Azure VMs, see Ddv4 and Ddsv4-series |
|  | i = isolated size |
|  | l = low memory; a lower amount of memory than the memory intensive size |
|  | m = memory intensive; the most amount of memory in a particular size |
|  | t = tiny memory; the smallest amount of memory in a particular size |
|  | s = Premium Storage capable, including possible use of Ultra SSD (Note: some newer sizes without the attribute of s can still support Premium Storage e.g. M128, M64, etc.) |
| \*Accelerator Type | Denotes the type of hardware accelerator in the specialized/GPU SKUs. Only the new specialized/GPU SKUs launched from Q3 2020 will have the hardware accelerator in the name. |
| Version | Denotes the version of the VM Family Series |
