# Introduction  
I want this to be a fun project to practice my problem solving skills in the context of extract, load, and transform (ETL) data using Apache Hop. Just spending my free time being curious about software in general. Poking things around is what I like to do. 

## Pre-requisites
- [Apache Hop 1.2.0](https://hop.apache.org/download/)
- [Azure Retail Prices REST API ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/cost-management/retail-prices/azure-retail-prices)
